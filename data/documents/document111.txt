amended to read                         Jurisdiction of offenses                    A person is subject to prosecution in this state for an offense which he commits          while either within or outside the state  by his own conduct or that of another for which he is         legally accountable  if                a   the offense is committed either wholly or partly within the state                b   the conduct outside the state constitutes an attempt to commit an offense within the         state                c   the conduct outside the state constitutes a conspiracy to commit an offense within         the state and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs in the state  or               d   the conduct within the state constitutes an attempt  solicitation  or conspiracy to         commit in another jurisdiction an offense under the laws of both this state and the other         jurisdiction                    An offense is committed partly within this state if either the conduct which is any         element of the offense  or the result which is an element  occurs within this state                    In homicide offenses  the  result  is either the physical contact which causes death         or the death itself                a   If the body of a homicide victim is found within the state  the death shall be         presumed to have occurred within the state                b   If jurisdiction is based on this presumption  this state retains jurisdiction unless the         defendant proves by clear and convincing evidence that                i   the result of the homicide did not occur in this state  and               ii   the defendant did not engage in any conduct in this state which is any element of         the offense                    a   An offense which is based on an omission to perform a duty imposed by the law         of this state is committed within the state regardless of the location of the offender at the time         of the omission                b   For the purpose of establishing venue for a violation of Subsection                      concerning  sex  offender registration  the offense is considered to be committed                i   at the most recent registered primary residence of the offender  if the actual location         of the offender at the time of the violation is not known  or               ii   at the location of the offender at the time the offender is apprehended                    a   If no jurisdictional issue is raised  the pleadings are sufficient to establish         jurisdiction                b   The defendant may challenge jurisdiction by filing a motion before trial stating         which facts exist that deprive the state of jurisdiction                c   The burden is upon the state to initially establish jurisdiction over the offense by a         preponderance of the evidence by showing under the provisions of Subsections     through             that the offense was committed either wholly or partly within the borders of the state                d   If after the prosecution has met its burden of proof under Subsection     c  the         defendant claims that the state is deprived of jurisdiction or may not exercise jurisdiction  the         burden is upon the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence                i   any facts claimed  and               ii   why those facts deprive the state of jurisdiction                    Facts that deprive the state of jurisdiction or prohibit the state from exercising         jurisdiction include the fact that the                a   defendant is serving in a position that is entitled to diplomatic immunity from         prosecution and that the defendant s country has not waived that diplomatic immunity                b   defendant is a member of the armed forces of another country and that the crime         that he is alleged to have committed is one that due to an international agreement  such as a         status of forces agreement between his country and the United States  cedes the exercise of         jurisdiction over him for that offense to his country                c   defendant is an enrolled member of an Indian tribe  as defined in Section                  and that the Indian tribe has a legal status with the United States or the state that vests         jurisdiction in either tribal or federal courts for certain offenses committed within the exterior         boundaries of a tribal reservation  and that the facts establish that the crime is one that vests         jurisdiction in tribal or federal court  or               d   offense occurred on land that is exclusively within federal jurisdiction                    a   The Legislature finds that identity fraud under Chapter    Part     Identity Fraud         Act  involves the use of personal identifying information which is uniquely personal to the         consumer or business victim of that identity fraud and which information is considered to be in         lawful possession of the consumer or business victim wherever the consumer or business         victim currently resides or is found                b   For purposes of Subsection     a   an offense which is based on a violation of         Chapter    Part     Identity Fraud Act  is committed partly within this state  regardless of the         location of the offender at the time of the offense  if the victim of the identity fraud resides or is         found in this state                    The judge shall determine jurisdiction               Section      Section          is amended to read                         Venue of actions                    Criminal actions shall be tried in the county  district  or precinct where the offense         is alleged to have been committed   In determining the proper place of trial  the following         provisions shall apply                a   If the commission of an offense commenced outside the state
