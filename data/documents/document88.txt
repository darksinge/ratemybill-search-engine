reversible illness  or pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the        environment               c   consistent with the degree and duration of risks associated with the disposal of        nonhazardous solid waste or treatment  storage  or disposal of specified hazardous waste         evidence of financial responsibility in whatever form and amount that the director determines is        necessary to insure continuity of operation and that upon abandonment  cessation  or        interruption of the operation of the facility or site  all reasonable measures

solid or hazardous waste               b   a description of the public benefits of the proposed facility  including               i   the need in the state for the additional capacity for the management of nonhazardous        solid or hazardous waste               ii   the energy and resources recoverable by the proposed facility               iii   the reduction of nonhazardous solid or hazardous waste management methods         which are less suitable for the environment  that would be made possible by the proposed        facility  and              iv   whether any other available site or method for the management of hazardous waste        would be less detrimental to the public health or safety or to the quality of the environment         and              c   compliance history of an owner or operator of a proposed commercial        nonhazardous solid or hazardous waste treatment  storage  or disposal facility  which may be        applied by the director in a

waste facility operation plan unless based on the application  and in addition to the        determination required in Subsections     and       the director determines that               a   the probable beneficial environmental effect of the facility to the state outweighs        the probable adverse environmental effect  and              b   there is a need for the facility to serve industry within the state                    Approval of a nonhazardous solid or hazardous waste operation plan may be        revoked  in whole or in part  if the person to whom approval of the plan has been given fails to        comply with that plan                    The director shall review all approved nonhazardous solid and hazardous waste        operation plans at least once every five
