this chapter if the owners of all property to be assessed voluntarily enter into a written        agreement with the local entity consenting to the assessment                   A local entity may allocate the cost of a benefit received by an unassessed        benefitted government property to all other benefitted property within the assessment area by        increasing the assessment levied against the other assessed property in the same proportion as        the improvement  operation and maintenance  or economic promotion activities are assessed Legislative Review NoteOffice of
