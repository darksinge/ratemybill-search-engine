professional  is authorized to issue a written order for the         immediate placement of a child not previously released from an order of commitment into a         more restrictive environment  if the local authority or its designee and the child s current         treating mental health professional has reason to believe that the less restrictive environment in         which the child has been placed is exacerbating his mental illness  or increasing the risk of         harm to himself or others                c   The written order described in Subsection      b  shall include the reasons for         placement in a more restrictive environment and shall authorize any peace officer to take the         child into physical custody and transport him to a facility designated by the appropriate local         mental health authority in conjunction with the child s current treating mental health         professional   Prior to admission to the more restrictive environment  copies

treatment provider or facility                d   If the child has been in a less restrictive environment for more than    days and is         aggrieved by the change to a more restrictive environment  the child or his representative may         request a review within    days of the change  by a neutral and detached fact finder as         described in Subsection       The fact finder shall determine whether                i   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is exacerbating         his mental illness  or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others  or               ii   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is not         exacerbating his mental illness  or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others  in which         case the fact finder shall designate that the child remain in the less restrictive environment                e   Nothing in this section prevents a local mental health authority or its designee  in         conjunction with the child s current mental health professional  from discharging a child from         commitment or from placing a child in an environment that is less restrictive than that         designated by the neutral and detached fact finder                     Each local mental health authority or its designee  in conjunction with the child s         current treating mental health professional shall discharge any child who  in the opinion of that         local authority  or its designee  and the child s current treating mental health professional  no         longer meets the criteria specified in Subsection      except as provided by Section   A                 The local authority and the mental health professional shall assure that any further supportive         services required to meet the child s needs upon release will be provided                     Even though a child has been committed to the physical custody of a local mental
