Legislative Review NoteThe Utah Legislature s Joint Rule         requires legislative general counsel to place alegislative review note on legislation  The Legislative Management Committee has furtherdirected legislative general counsel to include legal analysis in the legislative review note onlyif legislative general counsel determines there is a high probability that a court would declarethe legislation to be unconstitutional under the Utah Constitution  the United StatesConstitution  or both  As explained in the legal analysis below  legislative general counsel hasdetermined  based on applicable state and federal constitutional language and currentinterpretations of that language in state and federal court case law  that this legislation has ahigh probability of being declared unconstitutional by a court The bill provides confidentiality protections related to certain information concerningassessment of an entity s own risk and solvency stating that specified information may not besubject to subpoena  and may not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in anyprivate civil action   Another example of these confidentiality protections includes providingthat the insurance commissioner or any person who received a document  material  or otherinformation related to an own risk and solvency assessment  through examination or otherwise while acting under the authority of the commissioner or with whom the document  material  orother information is shared pursuant to this chapter may not be permitted or required to testifyin any private civil action concerning any confidential document  material  or information The above described confidentiality protections create rules of procedure or evidence   UtahConstitution  Article VIII

evidence with similar confidentiality requirements inUtah R  Evid  Rule      Insurance regulators  If the rules of procedure or evidence are notamended to address the confidentiality protections in
