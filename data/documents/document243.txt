required to be considered in the stage of the procurement         process at which best and final offers are being requested                    The best and final offer process may not be used to change                a   a determination that an offeror is not responsible to a determination that the offeror         is responsible  or               b   a determination that a proposal is not

identified in the request for proposals as a minimum         mandatory requirement  or               ii   alter the nature of the original request for proposals to the extent that a request for         proposals for the reduced scope of work would have likely attracted a significantly different set         of offerors submitting proposals in response to the request for proposals

responsive  and responsible  bid         offers procurement items that are produced  manufactured  mined  grown  or performed in a         state that gives or requires a preference  and if another responsible bidder has submitted a         responsive  and responsible  bid offering procurement items that are produced  manufactured          mined  grown  or performed in Utah  and with the benefit of the reciprocal preference  the bid         of the other bidder is equal to or less than the original lowest bid  the issuing procurement unit         shall                i   give notice to the
