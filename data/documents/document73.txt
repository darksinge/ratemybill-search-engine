review under this chapter  the        committee shall               a   consider whether state regulation of the occupation or profession is necessary to        address a compelling state interest in protecting against present  recognizable  and significant        harm to the health or safety of the public               b   consider if the committee s recommendations to the Legislature would

narrowly tailored to protect against present         recognizable  and significant harm to the health or safety of the public  and              ii   a potentially less restrictive alternative to licensing  including registration         certification  or exemption  would avoid unnecessary regulation while still protecting the health        and safety of the public  and               d    e   recommend to the Legislature any necessary changes to the proposed or        existing statute to ensure it is narrowly tailored to protect against present  recognizable  and        significant harm to

will significantly diminish an        identified risk to the health  safety  or welfare of the public               d   whether regulation of the occupation or profession               i   imposes significant new economic hardship on the public               ii   significantly diminishes the supply of qualified practitioners  or              iii   otherwise creates barriers to service that are not consistent with the public welfare        or interest               e   whether the occupation or profession requires knowledge  skills  and abilities that        are               i   teachable  and              ii   testable               f   whether the occupation or profession is clearly distinguishable from other        occupations or professions that are already regulated               g   whether the occupation or profession has               i   an established code of ethics               ii   a voluntary certification program  or              iii   other measures to ensure a

submitted for        the committee  shall  may study and make        recommendations regarding potentially less restrictive alternatives to licensing for the        regulation of occupations and professions  including registration  and   certification  or        exemption  if appropriate  that would  better  avoid unnecessary regulation  and intrusion upon        individual liberties by the
