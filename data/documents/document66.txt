company s articles of incorporation or bylaws  apportion the loss to each stockholder whose        failure to make beneficial use caused the loss of the water right               b   The water company shall make an apportionment if  the Utah Division of Water        Rights or  a court of proper jurisdiction makes a final decision that a loss has occurred               c   The water company shall also reduce the amount of water provided to the        shareholder in proportion to the amount of the lost water right during an appeal of a decision        that reduced the company water rights  unless otherwise ordered by a court of proper        jurisdiction               d   The water company may take any action under this Subsection      whether the loss        occurred               i   under Utah Code Annotated Section         including losses that occur as part of a        general determination under Title     Chapter    Determination of Water Rights  or              ii   through any other decision by a court of proper jurisdiction                   a   If the water company apportions a water right under Subsection      a sufficient        number of shares to account for the water right lost  including necessary transport or  carrier        water  losses  shall be treated by the water company as shares redeemed by the company from        the stockholder responsible for the loss               b   The number of shares owned by that shareholder shall be reduced accordingly on        the records of the company               c   Upon the redemption  the authorized shares of the company shall be reduced by the        amount of shares that were redeemed under this Subsection                       The redemption and retirement under this section of shares belonging to a        stockholder does not relieve the stockholder of liability for unpaid assessments on the stock or        debts the shareholder may owe to the water company Legislative Review NoteOffice of
