         JOINT RESOLUTION CALLING FOR REFORM OF THE      INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS           GENERAL SESSION      STATE OF UTAH      Chief Sponsor   Karianne Lisonbee      Senate Sponsor   Lincoln Fillmore             LONG TITLE      General Description             This joint resolution urges that gunsmith operations be removed from being labeled as       manufacturing activities        Highlighted Provisions             This resolution                   expresses concern over the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  interpretation of       gunsmith activities as manufacturing activities  and                  urges the President and Congress to take action to cease labeling gunsmithing       activities and to define the term  engaged in business  as found in the Gun Control       Act of             Special Clauses             None               Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah             WHEREAS  the United States Department of State s Directorate of Defense Trade       Controls is responsible for the export and temporary import of defense articles and services       governed by the Arms Export Control Act and Executive Order                   WHEREAS  the International Traffic in Arms Regulations implements the Arms       Export Control Act             WHEREAS  the Arms Export Control Act requires a person engaged in manufacturing       defense articles to register with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  pay an exorbitant       fee  and be subject to onerous paperwork whether or not they import or export defense related       articles and services             WHEREAS  gunsmiths have not previously been subject to the types of fees and       paperwork required by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  such as the guidelines on the       applicability of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations registration requirement  which       were issued in a Directorate of Defense Trade Controls letter on July           to firearms       manufacturers and gunsmiths             WHEREAS  these guidelines define many common gunsmith operations as        manufacturing  when they clearly are not and subject gun owners to the regulations for       performing these same common gunsmith operations on their privately owned guns  including       such innocuous activities as drilling into the receiver of their gun to install a new sight             WHEREAS  the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls began labeling commercial       gunsmiths as  manufacturers  for performing relatively simple work such as threading a barrel       or fabricating a small custom part for an older firearm             WHEREAS  under the Arms Export Control Act  manufacturers  are required to       register with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at significant expense or risk onerous       criminal penalties             WHEREAS  the guidance letter states that the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls       applies  the ordinary  contemporary  common meaning for manufacturing   however  it       neglects to define manufacturing and instead lists a wide variety of gunsmith activities while       declaring arbitrarily that they constitute manufacturing             WHEREAS  none of these activities are considered manufacturing activities by       common definition or by the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives             WHEREAS  the International Traffic in Arms Regulations state that  deemed export        violations are committed by providing any regulated good or service or any regulated technical       information to a  non US person   even within the United States  such that a gunsmith doing       routine gunsmithing for a  non US person  would constitute a violation             WHEREAS  neither ignorance of nor lack of intention to violate arcane and       complicated provisions buried in over     pages of legal statute  with ever changing lists of       regulated materials and information  is a defense to any violation             WHEREAS  violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations can result in       civil penalties of more than            per incident and criminal penalties of up to                  and    years in prison  both of which can be levied against individual gunsmithing business       employees             WHEREAS  the International Traffic in Arms Regulations have been applied in a       manner not intended  such as regulating information related to general scientific  mathematical        or engineering principles that are commonly taught in schools and colleges or information that       is in the public domain  and            WHEREAS  subjecting gunsmithing activities to the International Traffic in Arms       Regulations will result in small gunsmith businesses being forced out of business due to       regulatory costs and the significant risks of committing technical violations of extremely       complex laws and regulations             NOW  THEREFORE  BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah       urges the United States Congress to enact legislation to remove common gunsmithing activities       listed on the July           Directorate of Defense Trade Controls letter as activities that       constitute manufacturing under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations             BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the President of the United States is urged to direct       the United States Department of State s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to cease labeling       gunsmiths as manufacturers             BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the United States Congress is urged to define the       term  engaged in business  under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations as found in the       Gun Control Act of       which is  a person who devotes time  attention  and labor to       manufacturing firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of       livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the firearms manufactured              BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be sent to the President of       the United States  the Majority Leader of the United States Senate  the Speaker of the United       States House of Representatives  and the members of Utah s congressional delegation Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
