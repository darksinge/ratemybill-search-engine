division is not responsible for         investigating domestic violence in the presence of a child  as described in Section                               The division may not require a parent who has a child in the custody of the division         to pay for some or all of the cost of any drug testing the parent is required to undergo               Section      Section   A  a     is amended to read                 A  a      Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of         state                    a   Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state  a         parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care  custody  and management of the         parent s children   A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves         to challenge or interfere with parental rights   A governmental entity must support any actions         or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s         children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened         protection against government interference with the parent s fundamental rights and liberty         interests and  concomitantly  the right of the child to be reared by the child s natural parent                b   The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care  custody  and         management of the parent s children is recognized  protected  and does not cease to exist         simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent s child is placed in         the temporary custody of the state   At all times  a parent retains a vital interest in preventing         the irretrievable destruction of family life   Prior to an adjudication of unfitness  government         action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or         alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest   Until the state proves parental         unfitness  and the child suffers  or is substantially likely to suffer  serious detriment as a result          the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of         their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s parents are         adversaries                c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and         supervision of the child s natural parents   A child s need for a normal family life in a         permanent home  and for positive  nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the         child s natural parents   Additionally  the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to         conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected   The right of a fit  competent         parent to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a fundamental         liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental         public policy of this state                d   The state recognizes that                i   a parent has the right  obligation  responsibility  and authority to raise  manage          train  educate  provide and care for  and reasonably discipline the parent s children  and               ii   the state s role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent                e   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty         to exercise primary control over the care  supervision  upbringing  and education of their         children                f   Subsections     through     shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this         Subsection                        It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection         from abuse and neglect  and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating          prosecuting  and punishing abuse and neglect  as defined in this chapter  and in Title   A          Chapter    Juvenile Court Act  of         Therefore  the state  as parens patriae  has an interest         in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide         for their welfare   There may be circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a         substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and         proper parental care and protection   Under those circumstances  the state may take action for         the welfare and protection of the parent s children                    When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused  neglected  or dependent child          it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm and the extent to         which the child s extended family may provide needed protection   Throughout its involvement          the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to protect a         child  in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable  permanent families  rather         than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state                    When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s immediate safety         or welfare  the division may seek custody of the child for a planned  temporary period and         place the child in a safe environment  subject to the requirements of this section and in         accordance with the requirements of Title   A  Chapter    Part    Abuse  Neglect  and         Dependency Proceedings  and                a   when safe and appropriate  return the child to the child s parent  or               b   as a last resort  pursue another permanency plan                    In determining and making  reasonable efforts  with regard to a child  pursuant to         the provisions of Section   A  a      both the division s and the court s paramount concern         shall be the child s health  safety  and welfare   The desires of a parent for the parent s child          and the constitutionally protected rights of a parent  as described in this section  shall be given         full and serious consideration by the division and the court                    In cases where actual sexual abuse  sexual exploitation  abandonment  severe         abuse  or severe neglect are established  the state has no duty to make  reasonable efforts  or         to  in any other way  attempt to maintain a child in the child s home  provide reunification         services  or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents   This Subsection     does         not exempt the division from providing court ordered services                    a   In accordance with Subsection      the division shall strive to achieve         appropriate permanency for children who are abused  neglected  or dependent   The division         shall provide in home services  where appropriate and safe  in an effort to help a parent to         correct the behavior that resulted in abuse  neglect  or dependency of the parent s child  The         division may pursue a foster placement only if in home services fail or are otherwise         insufficient or inappropriate  kinship placement is not safe or appropriate  or in home services         and kinship placement fail and cannot be corrected  The division shall also seek qualified         extended family support or a kinship placement to maintain a sense of security and stability for         the child                b   If the use or continuation of  reasonable efforts   as described in Subsections             and      is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for a child  then measures         shall be taken  in a timely manner  to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan          and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child                c   Subject to the parental rights recognized and protected under this section  if           because of a parent s conduct or condition  the parent is determined to be unfit or incompetent         based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title   A  Chapter    Part            Termination of Parental Rights Act  the continuing welfare and best interest of the child is of         paramount importance  and shall be protected in determining whether that parent s rights         should be terminated                    The state s right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health         care for a child is subject to Subsections   A                 d  and   A          n  and         Section   A                       Section      Section   A  a

Subsection      the division shall provide in home services for the purpose of family         preservation to any family with a child whose health and safety is not immediately endangered

evidence of the finding described in Subsection     a  i  is         established if                A   a court previously adjudicated that the child suffered abuse  neglect  or dependency         involving the parent  and               B   a subsequent incident of abuse  neglect  or dependency involving the parent occurs                ii   For purposes of Subsection     a  iv   if the court finds that the parent knowingly         allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice         that the person physically abused  sexually abused  or

safely returned to the custody of the child s         parent or guardian through the provision of those services  the court shall place the child with         the child s parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division                b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a   and in ordering and         providing services  the child s health

situation in which the child could not safely remain at home  the court shall make a finding that         any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate                     In cases where actual sexual abuse  sexual exploitation  abandonment  severe         abuse  or severe neglect are involved  neither the division nor the court has any duty to make          reasonable efforts  or to  in any other way  attempt to maintain a child in the child s home          return a child to the child s home  provide reunification services  or attempt to rehabilitate the         offending parent or parents                     The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of         educational neglect as described in Subsection   A                 b   truancy  or failure to         comply with a court order to attend school                     a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section  the         court shall state the facts on which that decision is based                b   If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home  the court shall         state the facts on which that decision is based                     If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for         the protection of a child pursuant to Subsection     a   the court shall order continued removal         regardless of                a   any error in the initial removal of the child                b   the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions  or               c   any other procedural

  iv   other services                    Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing  and that         the minor remain in the custody of the division  the court shall first                a   establish a primary permanency plan for the minor  and               b   determine whether  in view of the primary permanency plan  reunification services         are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  pursuant to Subsections      through                         Subject to Subsections     and      if the court determines that reunification         services are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  the court shall provide for         reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed          unless parent time is not in the best interest of the minor                    In cases where obvious sexual abuse  sexual exploitation  abandonment  severe         abuse  or severe neglect are involved  neither the division nor the court has any duty to make          reasonable efforts  or to  in any other way  attempt to provide reunification services  or to         attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents                    In all cases  the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the court s paramount         concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made                    For purposes of Subsection      parent time is in the best interests of a minor unless         the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to                a   protect the physical safety of the minor                b   protect the life of the minor  or               c   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the         minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect                    Notwithstanding Subsection      a court may not deny parent time based solely on a         parent s failure to                a   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or               b   comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court                    a   In addition to the primary permanency plan  the court shall establish a         concurrent permanency plan that shall include                i   a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency plan will         be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency plan  and               ii   an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency         plan                b   In determining the primary permanency plan and concurrent permanency plan  the         court shall consider                i   the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement                ii   the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent child relationship is legally         terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available  and               iii   the use of an individualized permanency plan  only as a last resort                    A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection           A          b  within    days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if         something other than reunification is initially established as a minor s primary permanency         plan                     a   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency plan before the         establishment of a final permanency plan under Section   A                      b   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency plan in the event         that the primary permanency plan is abandoned                c   If  at any time  the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s primary         permanency plan  the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section           A       on or before the earlier of                i      days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this         Subsection      c   or               ii   the day on which the provision of reunification services  described in Section           A        ends                     a   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate   it  the court         shall order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the         minor s parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family  for a specified period         of time                b   In providing the services described in Subsection      a   the minor s health  safety          and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern  and the court shall so order                     a   The court shall                i   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child         and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division                ii   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family         plan in accordance with Subsection   A  a        e

assisting in any future         determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts  in accordance with state and         federal law                b   If the parent is in a substance  abuse  use disorder treatment program  other than a         certified drug court program                i   the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in         addition to the testing recommended by the parent s substance  abuse  use disorder program         based on a finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol  and               ii   the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing         recommended by the substance  abuse  use disorder program to the court or division                     a   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the         date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home  unless the time period is         extended under Subsection   A                         b   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire            months of reunification services                     a   If reunification services are ordered  the court may terminate those services at         any time                b   If  at any time  continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined         to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section           A        then measures shall be taken  in a timely manner  to                i   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and               ii   complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the         minor                     Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period         described in Subsections      through      does not interrupt the running of the period                     a   If reunification services are ordered  a permanency hearing shall be conducted         by the court in accordance with Section   A       at the expiration of the time period for         reunification services                b   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original         removal of the minor                c   If reunification services are not ordered  a

minors who are abused  neglected  or dependent  the Legislature finds that a         parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited                b   The court may determine that                i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate          based on the individual circumstances  and               ii   reunification services should not be provided                c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor  and in         making  reasonable efforts   the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the paramount         concern                     There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a         parent if the court finds  by clear and convincing

associates  establishing         that  even with the provision of services  the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately         caring for the minor within    months after the day on which the court finding is made                b   A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection      k  if the court finds  under         the circumstances of the case  that the substance  abuse  use disorder treatment described in         Subsection      k  is not warranted                     In determining whether reunification services are appropriate  the court shall take         into

on which         the out of home placement of the minor is made  the court may order the division to provide         reunification services                b   The time limits described in Subsections
