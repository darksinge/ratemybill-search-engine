Sponsor   Ken Ivory      Senate Sponsor    Allen M  Christensen             LONG TITLE       General Description             This joint resolution of the Legislature urges the President of the United States and       Congress to recognize state authority and take action to restore power to the states        Highlighted Provisions             This resolution                   calls upon the

encourages other states to join with the state of Utah in documenting issues of       federal overreach        Special Clauses             None               Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah             WHEREAS  the genius of the United States of America lies in the liberty of our people       to govern ourselves at the most local level  to solve our unique problems  to foster prosperity       through our liberty  and to cultivate our unique endowment of human  capital  and natural       resources             WHEREAS  America s unique structure of government known as federalism  secures       the local voice and liberty of the people through clear divisions of responsibility between state       and federal governments  as explained in Federalist      the power surrendered by the people is           divided between two distinct governments  state and national             WHEREAS  the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution establishes the       overarching theory and structure of our constitutional form of government to protect the       people s liberty by stating   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution        nor prohibited by it to the States  are reserved to the States respectively  or to the people              WHEREAS  former Utah Governor Scott Matheson stated  Federalism is neither a       partisan issue  nor is it an issue dividing liberals and conservatives  It s a philosophical concept       of how the federal governmental system operates  an effort to determine the proper role of state       and federal governments              WHEREAS  James Madison  the primary author of the Constitution  described these       clear and certain constitutional divisions of responsibility most plainly in Federalist     saying       the powers delegated to the national government are  few and defined   over primarily        external objects   and clarified that the powers reserved to the states concern  the lives        liberties  and properties of the people  and the internal order  improvement  and prosperity of       the State   and are  numerous and indefinite   Federalist                 WHEREAS  in Federalist     Madison warned the  accumulation of all powers        legislative  executive  and judiciary  in the same hands     may justly be pronounced the very       definition of tyranny   and the power delegated through the executive branch to unelected        unaccountable federal bureaucrats who make  enforce  and adjudicate their own rules  as if they       were laws  fits the definition of tyranny that Madison described             WHEREAS  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court  John Roberts stated  If no enumerated       power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law  that law may not be enacted  even if it would       not violate any of the express prohibitions in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the       Constitution  Nat l Fed n of Indep  Bus  v  Sebelius      S  Ct                                WHEREAS  absent a clear and certain division of responsibility between state and       national governments  the structure of federalism is undermined and the resulting power       vacuum is  by nature  filled by the government with the most accumulated power             WHEREAS  throughout the   th and   st centuries  regulations  laws  executive       orders  and court rulings emanating from the federal government have proliferated  and have       been met by agreement  acquiescence  or inaction of the states  which has blurred the divisions       of responsibility between the federal government and the states  resulting in a power vacuum       that has further distorted the constitutional divisions  separations  and limits on the  few and       defined  powers constitutionally delegated to the national government             WHEREAS  James Madison wisely noted   There are more instances of the       abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in       power than by violent and sudden usurpations              WHEREAS  the assumption of power that was never delegated to the federal       government under the Constitution undermines the constitutional architecture of federalism       instituted to  secure to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power        Bond v  United States      U S                              WHEREAS   The structure of our government is central to liberty  and when we       destroy it  we place liberty at peril  Nat l Fed n of Indep  Bus  v  Sebelius      S  Ct                              Scalia  Thomas  Kennedy  and Alito dissenting              WHEREAS  any activity that undermines the core federalism structure of our       government also erodes the voice and liberty of the people in determining the destiny        opportunity  creativity  and dynamism of their own lives and their unique communities and       states to the detriment of the nation as a whole             WHEREAS  on October           President Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order             on federalism  to restore the division of governmental responsibilities between the       national government and the States that was intended by the Framers of the Constitution and to       ensure that the principles of federalism established by the Framers guide the Executive       departments and agencies in the formulation and implementation of policies              WHEREAS  President Donald J  Trump declared in his      Inaugural Address   we       are not merely transferring power from one administration to another  or from one party to       another but we are transferring power from Washington  D C   and giving it back to you  the       American People              WHEREAS  Rep  Jason Chaffetz  Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform  has reached out to state legislatures around the country to document their       experiences with federal overreach and unfunded mandates with a view to restoring power to       the states and to the people             WHEREAS  in       the Utah Legislature established the Utah Commission on       Federalism  the Commission  to  assess overreaching federal actions  respond to actions       through a measured dispute resolution process  coordinate with Utah s congressional delegation        and with other states  and report actions and results to the Legislature              WHEREAS  at the request of Utah Senate President Wayne Niederhauser and Utah        Speaker of the House of Representatives Greg Hughes  the Commission convened public        hearings throughout the      legislative session to receive reports from the various Senate and        House standing and appropriation committee chairs  state officials  staff  and members of the        public concerning federal actions that constitute examples of federal overreach  erode the        structural guarantees of federalism  or restrain the right and liberty of our people to govern        ourselves              WHEREAS  the Commission received the following summary of federal
